- ### FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT
  - Given more time I would like to add the "lizard" and "spock" choices for the [game](https://bigbangtheory.fandom.com/wiki/Rock,_Paper,_Scissors,_Lizard,_Spock) popularized by the tv show "big pang theory"
  - I would like to add a footer that when clicked, expands revealing the rules for the game mentioned above.
